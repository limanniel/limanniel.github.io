<h1>Super aMAZEing Game, was a project created as an ice-breaker during the start of the University. The idea of the game is simple, you get randomly spawned in a maze and you need to make your way to the centre "red plate" to finish the level, throughout your journey you will encounter speed-up power-ups as well as obscure vision power-downs.</h1>

<h1>This project was a very first time that I have touched Unity Engine, and as for first time. I think I didn't do too bad, as I've managed to achieve everything that I wanted. Be it obscuring vision through overlay texture over the camera, applying force to the sphere to move in a fashion that you can feel the weight. Or even simply creating spawn points for items and such.</h1>

<h1>The whole experience was pleasant and didn't feel too daunting, which I had fears about before starting it. I've learnt the basics of Unity Engine as well as bonded with my team-mate. For which this activity was created for in the first place :)</h1>
