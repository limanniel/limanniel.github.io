<h1>Apocatree is a "game" built for Ukie's Green Game Jam 2019, around the theme of Climate Change / Sustainability. The game idea was strongly inspired by Plague Inc, as the goal of the game was to convert the post-apocalyptic barren world. Into essentially a new home for humanity, firstly by planting miraculous "mother tree" that would over time grow new trees all around the map.</h1>

<h1>The game, in the end, wasn't fully finished, because of our team "trying to bite, more than can chew". That is because we've spent good 12+ hours, trying to figure out the Tile System and AI in unity engine. Which happened to be the first time using the engine for the majority of us, or others had small experience using it.</h1>
</br>
<h1>Problems started to arise straight-up from using Unity's very own tilemap and tile system, that is because it doesn't allow any additional data to be passed onto tiles used in tilemap because of performance advantage and the way it was made. After a few hours of being unable to figure it out, the team decided to hard code values accordingly and just read them in. Which was a horrible solution that worked temporarily.</h1>

</br>
<h1>Regardless of our temporary solution, we decided to move on to get something done. The team moved onto coding ai for "humans" that would control where they settle etc... That to say was a bit too ambitious as well, because we've tried to include Heuristic from tiles based on the availability of water, climate and such that would dictate where humans would put their houses down first. Which got to say worked half of the times, that being around 5 am in the morning where people that were assigned in making this AI went away to get well-deserved rest.</h1>
</br>
<h1>This left 3 of us (including me) with broken AI and hard-coded tile system that was bound to break at some point. With us not understanding what has been done to AI, and not willing to spend any longer on that. We decided to scrap what has been done in that regard and simplify our game idea.</h1>
<h1>With that in place, over the course of the next 6 or so hours. We got much more done than we did throughout the whole time earlier on. Which only shows how the badly overly complicated mechanism can mess up the whole schedule.</h1>
</br>
<h1>I was assigned to make re-make the whole tree spreading mechanism, which went surprisingly smooth. I did encounter the same problem that we had earlier with tiles though where I needed to get the position of each individual tile, which means that I would need to pass additional data to each tile. After a bit of thinking, I've come up with an ingenious idea to solve this problem!</h1>

</div>
<h1>That idea being, making a struct that will contain generic tile that gets generated from tilemap and combining it with any data that I would need. In this scenario is a position which I calculate and assign when tilemap gets created. This itself if popped in my mind earlier, would save so much time and struggle from earlier. Better late than never, eh?</h1>
</br>
<h1>To summarise, the whole experience of the game jam was pleasant regardless of the many problems with the project. That is because, in the end, we had a lot of fun making it, as well as our group,  bonded a lot from this activity! On another side, it taught all of us a lot in terms of scaling project accordingly especially during game jams where time is crucial, as well as not to dwell for hours on something that doesn't work and is stopping everyone else from working.</h1>
