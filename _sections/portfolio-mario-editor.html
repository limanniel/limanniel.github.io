<h1>Level editor based off Retro Mario Bros game, that allows the player to create own levels, save and play through. Game comes with one pre-defined level to work as a guidance in what you can make yourself. Game has been built using own framework powered by SDL library to provide means to talk with hardware to draw sprites/play sounds/poll inputs etc...</h1>

<h1>
    This project has taught me a lot, as was a first ever approach in making framework that will essentially mimic a game engine. That later would be used in making a game (Mario level editor in this case). I've earned a lot of experience in making reusable general classes as well as systems that will govern application built within and allow functionality and mechanics.
</h1>
</br>
<h1>
    Throughout the project I’ve built multiple classes as part of the framework, being:
    <ul>
        <li>GameScreenManager</li>
        <li>Texture2D</li>
        <li>Text</li>
        <li>Collisions</li>
        <li>Tile</li>
        <li>Entity</li>
    </ul>
    which all encompass some logic often tied with SDL functions, to provide means of doing particular task in most efficient and easiest way, essentially abstracting away from any confusion making using the framework a breeze to create app/game within.
</h1>
</br>
<h1>
    For example, loading and saving a texture is as simple as:
</h1>
<pre><code>
    Texture2D* _texture = new Texture2D(renderer);
    _texture->LoadFromFile(Path);
</code></pre>
<h1>just by abstracting away SDL functionality into TextureClass that allows developer to quickly and efficiently do a task without having to worry about 10's of lines of code, and instead using just one function on a variable that will do everything for them.</h1>
</br>
<h1>Another case of providing easy means to do particular task would be Collisions class, as has been made to be a Singleton Class which means that you can use it's functionality to compare two objects whether they collide by using either AABB (box collision) or Circle collision check, without the need of instantiating the class.</h1>
<pre><code>
    Collisions::Instance()->Box(object1, object2);
</code></pre>
<h1>
    That being said, creation of this framework and later on a game within wasn't free of problems. Particularly encountered many in regard of memory leaking, as was first time that I’ve used extensively raw pointers which can become troublesome if not cleared correctly when not being used anymore. After some time of debugging and tracing creation of every troublesome pointer I did manage to get rid of those mistakes, giving me yet again even more experience in debugging and using pointers/memory addresses.
