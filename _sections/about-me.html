<h1>Hello! My name is <strong>Sebastian Ploch</strong> and I'm aspiring Games Programmer, currently getting a degree on Games Programming at Staffordshire University. I've been passionate towards technology and games since youngest days, but predominately programming is what gives me the most fun and feels the most rewarding but equally challenging. I see myself as a open-minded, quick-learning and humble being that dreams to work in an industry that combines both of my dream worlds!</h1>
