<h1>
    This Project being my first game ever written purely in code using just small library was definitely a test of my not so long ago acquired c++ knowledge. This taught me a lot as didn't have any more colossal engine sitting on top that can do pretty much anything in matter of just few clicks or functions, but instead had to code it all in here by myself. Being left to myself and my creativity contributed in gaining a lot of valuable experience. Be it in general game design principles to thinking how will structure my code or logic behind mechanisms i will need. On top of that, I’ve also expanded my code base further, as had to use new libraries that never encountered before or even to use previously known ones to me in different ways. In general, this project also shaped the way I write and name variables, so they're consistent and are not confusing at any point, such as sticking to Camel-Case naming convention or pre-fixing local to class variables with underscore.

<h1>Biggest obstacle I've encountered throughout this project was order and logic in which I was deleting/freeing objects, often resulting in exception errors due to the fact of trying to delete something that was deleted already and essentially being null. With enough of time I’ve managed to squash those bugs out. Whole process taught me a valuable lesson and improved my debugging and coding skills. In the future should be able to avoid such mistakes altogether, and even if it happens again, I will be able to tackle and debug those much quicker.</h1>
