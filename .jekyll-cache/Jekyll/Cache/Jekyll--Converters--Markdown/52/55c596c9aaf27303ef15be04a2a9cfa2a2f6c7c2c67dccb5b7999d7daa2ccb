I"P<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Voxel-o-Defence was a University group project for the "Technical Games Production" module in the 3rd Semester, Second year of the degree during which, we've been tasked to create a game and simulate "working in the studio" conditions.
For the game, our team decided to use raw DirectX 11 with addition of DirectXTK to aid the process and make it possible to accomplish within a tight 6 weeks timeframe.
My part in the project includes
- The boilerplate code
    - Shader Compilation &amp; Management
    - Render &amp; Update pipeline
    - Object Abstraction
    - Wrapper classes for DirectXTK library
- Camera system (FPS &amp; Isometric)
- Audio Handling
- Skybox
- Debug Objects
- Simple templetized debug logging
</code></pre></div></div>
