I"¥<p>Voxel-o-Defence was a University group project for the â€œTechnical Games Productionâ€ module in the 3rd Semester, Second year of the degree during which, weâ€™ve been tasked to create a game and simulate â€œworking in the studioâ€ conditions.
For the game, our team decided to use raw DirectX 11 with addition of DirectXTK to aid the process and make it possible to accomplish within a tight 6 weeks timeframe.</p>
